- Basic Latin alphabets (A-Z, a-z)
- Diacritics latin alphabets (üá´üá∑, üá©üá™ and more!)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Basic punctuations and symbols
- and more (‚Ä¶?)

## Kerning Preview

![Kerning](preview/Kerning.svg)
> _The World Unsundered_

Manually adjusted kerning pairs for improved readability. Toggle "Metrics" setting in your preferred design software to apply.

I've adjusted the kerning to a looser fit, compared to [my Eorzean font](https://github.com/karaipsum/Eorzean-Typeface).

## Opentype Features Support (default off)

Below are currently supported Opentype features. They are based on my personal idea and interpretation, which I haven't noticed in official arkworks so far. They are **off** by default. You may turn it on for fun.

### Discretionary Ligature `dlig`
