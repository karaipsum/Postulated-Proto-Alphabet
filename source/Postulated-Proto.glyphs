- All glyphs reworked based on Augmented Neo-Eorzean, sharing mostly the same metrics
- Applied a loose kerning style, resulting in less kerning pairs

2024-05-22 1.010
- Reworked kerning
- adjusted punctuation marks, applied case form

[New kerning groups]

Left:

LCB: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from cap-height to baseline on the left side
refLSB: I

LCB-x: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from cap-height to baseline on the left side + a cross-bar (mid)
refLSB: J

LCB-xb: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from cap-height to baseline on the left side + a cross-bar (bottom)
refLSB: j

LxB: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from x-height to baseline on the left side
refLSB: i

LxB-x: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from x-height to baseline on the left side + a cross-bar
refLSB: n

LxDB: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from x-height to ~descender on the left side
refLSB: f

Right:

RCB: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from cap-height to baseline on the right side
refRSB: I

RxB: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from x-height to baseline on the right side
refRSB: i

RxDB: glyphs where there’s a vertical bar from x-height to ~descender on the right side
refRSB: t
